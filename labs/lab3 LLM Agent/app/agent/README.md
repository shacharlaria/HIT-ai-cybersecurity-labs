## 1. Agent Name

**data-analysis-demo-agent**

---

## 2. Agent Purpose

The purpose of this agent is to demonstrate **basic agent development with tool usage** and to illustrate **how responsibility is split between tools and the agent itself**.

This agent is designed to:
- interact with the user about available datasets,
- retrieve structured information via tools,
- reason about and explain datasets in natural language.

This description serves as a **technical task specification for the agent's system prompt**.

> **Educational focus:**  
> This agent operates on small, in-memory example datasets.  
> It is intentionally simplified and does not represent a complete or production-ready solution.

---

## 3. Agent Tools

This agent uses **three tools**, each illustrating a different level of data preparation.

### 3.1 `list_datasets`

**Purpose:**  
Provides an overview of all available datasets.

**Output includes:**
- dataset name,
- number of records,
- number of fields,
- field names.

**Design principle:**  
The tool returns **fully prepared metadata**, allowing the agent to immediately reason about dataset structure.

---

### 3.2 `describe_dataset(dataset_name)`

**Purpose:**  
Provides detailed information about a single dataset.

**Input:**
- `dataset_name` – name of the dataset to describe.

**Output includes:**
- dataset name,
- number of records,
- number of fields,
- field names,
- one example row.

**Design principle:**  
The tool summarizes the dataset instead of exposing raw data.

---

### 3.3 `show_data(dataset_name)`

**Purpose:**  
Returns the **raw records** of a selected dataset.

**Input:**
- `dataset_name` – name of the dataset.

**Output includes:**
- dataset name,
- raw data rows.

**Educational note:**  
This tool is included **only for demonstration purposes**, for example to produce clearer screenshots or to illustrate what raw data looks like.

> **Important:**  
> In student submissions, tools should generally return **structured, summarized, or aggregated data**, not raw datasets.  
> Raw data access is intentionally shown here as a *counterexample*.

---

## 4. Tool–Agent Responsibility Split

This agent demonstrates the following fundamental rule:

> **Tools are responsible for data retrieval, preparation, and structuring.**  
> **The agent is responsible for reasoning, explanation, and interpretation.**

Examples:
- Tools compute dataset statistics and structure.
- The agent explains what the datasets contain and how they can be interpreted.
- Even when raw data is available, the agent should rely primarily on structured outputs.

This separation is a **core expectation** for student agents in this course.

---

## 5. Implementation Details

This agent uses:
- **AG2** `ConversableAgent` for the LLM-powered assistant,
- the `functions=[...]` argument to expose tools to the agent,
- **Chainlit** for the chat UI with **Step visualization** of tool calls.

### AG2 Single-Agent Tool Pattern

This example uses the simpler single-agent tool pattern:

```python
assistant = ConversableAgent(
    name="dataset_analysis_agent",
    system_message=SYSTEM_PROMPT,
    llm_config=llm_config,
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    functions=[list_datasets, describe_dataset, show_data],
)
```

The AG2 assistant decides when to call a tool, executes it through the framework,
and then produces a final answer based on the tool result.

Each tool call is shown in the Chainlit UI as an expandable **Step**, displaying both input arguments and output data.

## 6. Example Interaction

```
User: what datasets do we have available?

Agent: Here are the datasets currently available:
  | Dataset   | Records | Fields | Field Names                          |
  |-----------|---------|--------|--------------------------------------|
  | customers | 2       | 3      | id, name, country                    |
  | orders    | 3       | 4      | order_id, customer_id, amount, currency |

  Let me know if you'd like more details on any of them!

User: show the full content of the orders dataset

Agent: orders
  | order_id | customer_id | amount | currency |
  |----------|-------------|--------|----------|
  | 100      | 1           | 120.5  | USD      |
  | 101      | 2           | 99.9   | GBP      |
  | 102      | 1           | 250.0  | USD      |

  Let me know what you'd like to do next!
```

## 7. Limitations of This Example

- Datasets are hard-coded and stored in memory.
- No file loading or external data sources are used.
- The `show_data` tool exposes raw data, which is **not recommended** for real agents.

> **Note:**  
> This agent is a **reference example**, not a complete lab solution.  
> Student agents should focus on **well-designed tools that return agent-ready data**.

---

## Additional Notes

- This agent represents the **minimum acceptable level** of tool usage.
- It demonstrates both good practices (structured tools) and intentional shortcuts (raw data access).
- Understanding this example is essential before moving on to:
  - agent-as-tool patterns,
  - multi-agent systems,
  - attacker–evaluator–defender scenarios.
